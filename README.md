# Excel Data Analysis Project - Bike Buyers Dataset

## Overview

This project analyzes the **Bike Buyers** dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains demographic and purchasing behavior data of customers related to bike purchases. The goal of this analysis was to explore patterns in bike purchasing decisions based on factors like gender, age, and commute distance.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Bike Buyers Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/bike-buyers)
- **Description**: The dataset includes various attributes such as gender, age, income, commute distance, and whether or not the individual purchased a bike.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis were to:
1. Clean the dataset by removing duplicates.
2. Use nested `IF` functions to categorize or manipulate data based on multiple conditions.
3. Create pivot tables and charts to visualize the relationship between bike purchases and different demographic factors.

## Data Cleaning

- **Duplicate Removal**: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

## Analysis

### 1. Bike Purchases by Gender
- **Method**: Created a pivot table to aggregate the number of bike purchases by gender.
- **Visualization**: A Column chart was used to visualize the difference in bike purchases between male and female customers and average income.

### 2. Bike Purchases by Age Group
- **Method**: Used nested `IF` functions to categorize customers into age groups, and then created a pivot table to analyze bike purchases by these groups.
- **Visualization**: A smooth line chart was used to show the distribution of bike purchases across different age groups.

### 3. Bike Purchases by Commute Distance
- **Method**: Analyzed the relationship between commute distance and bike purchases using a pivot table.
- **Visualization**: A line chart was used to represent the number of bike purchases for various commute distances.

## Conclusion

This analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing bike purchases. The visualizations helped to clearly understand the patterns and trends within the data, which could be useful for targeted marketing or customer segmentation strategies.
